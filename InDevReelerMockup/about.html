		<h2>About InDevReeler</h2>
		<p>
		While it technically is possible to make video games as a <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/team-shanghai-alice/3010-6355/">one man army,</a>
		doing so is usually extremely daunting, difficult, and time consuming. Very few individuals are
		willing do do so. Typically, if one were to completely make a game on their own, they would have to perform the 
		role of game designer, project manager, producer, artist, programmer, quality assurance, as well as sound and music composer. 
		In most cases, (even in indie game development) there is typically a small team of individuals, each performing their own specialty in 
		order to create a complete product. However, while many people have the talents to do some of these tasks individually, 
		finding team members to work with can be a major hurdle for many. Many indivuduals also have many great ideas for video games, 
		but are unable to act upon their ideas as indivuduals.
		</p>
		<p>
		InDevReeler is aiming to work towards conqering this initial and crucial step of indie game development. 
		While there are already some services, such as <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> where source code can be collaborated and games themselves can be hosted/downloaded,
		there is a need for a specialized service for the formation and collaboration of a independent game development team. There are other services 
		out there where this could be performed through listings that can be created searching for people to take on specific jobs, but these other services
		are not typically specialized in indie game development team formation/collaboration. 
		</p>
